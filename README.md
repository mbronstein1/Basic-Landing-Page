# Landing-Page-Mini-Project-1

## Description

This is the first mini-challenge in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp (Module 1). The assignment was to create a simple static landing page using HTML and CSS that featured a header, a navbar, a main section with an image, some text, a form with a name and email input, and a footer (see guidelines below). I also incorporated a few animations, including a button color animation on-hover as well as a set of hand emojis that wave every 2.5 seconds.
